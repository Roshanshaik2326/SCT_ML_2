# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This project segments customers of a retail store using the K-Means clustering algorithm based on their age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to group similar customers for targeted marketing.

📌 Key Steps:
Data preprocessing and EDA

Applied Elbow Method to find optimal clusters

Implemented K-Means clustering

Visualized clusters using 2D (Matplotlib) and 3D (Plotly)

🛠️ Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 📊 Project Overview

- 📁 Dataset: [Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- 🎯 Goal: Group customers into clusters based on spending behavior and demographics.
- 🤖 ML Model: Unsupervised Learning using **K-Means Clustering**
- 📌 Clusters help businesses understand customer patterns and create marketing strategies.
